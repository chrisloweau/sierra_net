https://github.com/0day-ci/linux/blob/28bed2ba87fdf5cce38580642743878de24d1734/drivers/net/usb/sierra_net.c

Stefan has submitted the update for inclusion with later kernel releases, and when accepted this code will become deprecated.

This implementation has had minor modifications to allow it to be compiled for the Raspberry Pi.


##How to Compile this Driver Yourself##

1. Install **Git**

      ```
      sudo apt-get install git -y
      ```

2. Download **sierra_net** Repository

      ```
      cd ~
      git clone https://github.com/chrisloweau/sierra_net.git
      ```

3. Install **Raspberry Pi Kernel Source**

      As this is a kernel driver, you will need to install the Raspberry Pi kernel
      source before you can compile the source code. The easiest way to obtain this
      is to use the [Raspberry Pi Kernel Source Installer](https://github.com/notro/rpi-source) tool.

      Prerequisite:
      
      ```
      sudo apt-get install bc
      ```
      
      Install Commnands:
      
      ```
      sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notro/rpi-source/master/rpi-source -O /usr/bin/rpi-source
      sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-source
      /usr/bin/rpi-source -q --tag-update
      rpi-source
      ```
