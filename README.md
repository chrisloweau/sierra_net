Stefan has submitted his update for inclusion with later kernel releases, and
when accepted this code will become deprecated.

This implementation has had minor modifications to allow it to be compiled for
the Raspberry Pi.







HOW TO COMPILE THE DRIVER YOURSELF
----------------------------------

As this is a kernel driver, you will need to install the Raspberry Pi kernel
source before you can compile the source code. The easiest way to obtain this
is to use the 'Raspberry Pi Kernel Source Installer' tool.
