It has been submitted for inclusion with later kernel releases, and this code
will become deprecated at that time.

This implementation has had minor modifications to allow it to be compiled for
the Raspberry Pi.







HOW TO COMPILE THE DRIVER YOURSELF
----------------------------------

As this is a kernel driver, you will need to install the Raspberry Pi kernel
source before you can compile the source code. The easiest way to obtain this
is to use the 'Raspberry Pi Kernel Source Installer' tool.
